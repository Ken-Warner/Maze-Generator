# Maze-Generator
A simple maze generation tool that creates an object graph in Javascript for a maze. Also contains some simple path finding algorithms.

The program creates an HTML canvas. The user can input dimensions for the maze and cells within the maze, but there are defaults. The maze is generated by using a recursive
backtracking algorithm. The user can watch the maze construction in real time. There are also examples of BFS and DFS algorithms that can traverse the maze and be compared.
